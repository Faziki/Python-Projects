# ================== How to Calculate Interest ==================
# Simple interest rate is calculated as follows:
#   A = P(1 + r * t)
#   The Python equivalent is very similar:
#       A =P*(1+r*t)

# Compound interest rate is calculated as follows:
#   A = P(1 + r) ^ t
#   The Python equivalent is slightly different:
#       A = P* math.pow((1+r),t)

# ‘r’ is the interest entered divided by 100, e.g. if 8% is entered, then r is 0.08.
# 'P' is the initial amount deposited
# 't' is the number of years of the investment



if interestType == "Simple":
    print('Your Simple Interest is: ',(P*(1+r*t)))
elif interestType == "Compound":
    print('Your Compound Interest is: ',(P* math.pow((1+r),t)))
else:
    print("Oops! you haven't selected 'Simple' or 'Compound'")

time.sleep(100)

# interestType = input("Enter if Simple or Compound interest:  ")
# A = 0.00
